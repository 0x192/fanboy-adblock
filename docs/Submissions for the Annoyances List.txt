        * For users not wanting International support, an English only list is available.

Submission of Filters
-===================-
        * The site needs to be fairly popular to get any site specific blocks.
        * If the site some decent generic elements, filters or commonly used 3rd party annoyances, it may* be accepted for inclusion.

Filters not accepted
-===================-
        * If the site is designed around social aspect, the filters will be either whitelisted, excempted or removed.
        * Disabling comments used by the social websites (such as facebook chat within a website)
        * Disabling donation buttons (assuming they don't override or hide webpage content)
        * Blocking of some popular sites outright like Twitter, Facebook etc. Just aiming to block the certain scripts used on each site.
        * If a blocked toolbar or CSS element limits functionality of site, it shall be removed. (searching, Login to the site)
           => If the site can off functionality through another method, blocking a toolbar
