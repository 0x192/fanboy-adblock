                              Adding Filters 
                              **************


CSS Filering:
-------------

    If no blocking filters are required. A simple,
    
            "winscript site: http://..." is only needed (no adzilla needed)

Filters:
--------

    If blocking/Whitelist filters are required (in either Firefox, Opera or Iron)
    Using your adzilla login, add the site, and paste the ad url's involved (in the comments).
    Once its been added,
    
            "winscript adzilla: #xxxx"  (xxxx being the record ID)
    
    Adzilla is used for tracking of additions. So we can work out why blocking rules/whitelists 
    were added, helps with improving filters if problems occur down the track.
     
    Note: Once the filter has been uploaded to googlecode set the Adzilla record to be "Completed".

                          **************************

Iron
----

Issues/Notes: 

      (1) Iron doesn't support wildcards
      ------------------------------
      So www.website.com/*adbanner* wont work.

      (2) Iron only supports full url (complete, unbroken urls)
      -----------------------------------------------------
      Typing in complete urls, http://www.website.com/img/adbanner.jpg
      
      (3) a "/" wont cover http://
      ------------------------
      This wont work in iron, /adbrite.com/
      Better to use http://adbrite.com or .adbrite.com (if it has a "." in front)

      (4) Blocking a url, will stop the page from load it
      -----------------------------------------------
      Even if you visit the site manually, it won't load, be careful.
           
      (5) Iron filters are case sensitive
      -----------------------------------
      So *adbanner* isn't the same as *adBanner* or *Adbanner* etc, a filter will
      need to be created for each instantance. Best to *only* add the case involved.
      Adding for each case just adds bloat, we only add filters that we'll come across.

      (6) Filtering
      --------------
      * If the filter has http://www.adserver.com, just filter create the filter .adserver.com/
      * If the filter is like http://site.com/banners.phps?, a filter using the http://.. is needed.
      
Opera
-----

      (1) Avoid the use of the "=" in the urlfilter
      ---------------------------------------------
      Just slows things down in Opera
    
      (2) CSS filtering
      -----------------
      Basic CSS filtering is supported, but lacking in features like excemptions. Unless the filter is really popular
      and causes plenty of false positives, we recommend disabling the CSS filter on sites that it may break.
      
      (3) Blocking a url, will stop the page from load it
      -----------------------------------------------
      Even if you visit the site manually, it won't load, be careful.

      (4) Opera filters support Wilcards.. however
      --------------------------------------------
      Limit the amount of wildcards used 3 at the most, more wildcards the slower the content filter in Opera.

      (5) Opera filters are case sensitive
      -----------------------------------
      So *adbanner* isn't the same as *adBanner* or *Adbanner* etc, a filter will
      need to be created for each instantance. Best to *only* add the case involved.
      Adding for each case just adds bloat, we only add filters that we'll come across.
