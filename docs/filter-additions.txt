Adding Filters 

Iron
----
x Iron doesn't support wildcards

so www.website.com/*adbanner* wont work.

x Iron only supports full url (complete, unbroken urls)

http://www.website.com/img/adbanner.jpg

this wont work in iron, /adbrite.com/  , 
better to use the full url, if you're intending to block that url
=> http://adbrite.com/

x The "/" only means directory seperator in iron, not http://

x Iron filters are case sensitive

Opera
-----
x Opera supports wildcards

x Will block access to the site directly, so you have to be careful what to block.

example of workable filters:

*.domain.com/*banner*
*.domain.com/*.swf
http://*.domain.com/test/*
*.domain.com/test/me/*
*/domain.com/*

x Limit the amount of wildcards used 3 at the most, more wildcards the slower the content filter in Opera.

x Opera filters are case sensitive
